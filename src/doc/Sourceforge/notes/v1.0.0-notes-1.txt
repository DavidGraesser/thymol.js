Hi All,

  I'm very pleased to announce the publication of a new version of Thymol. The latest version is thymol-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT and includes major capability improvements compared to the previous release 0.1.2.

Thymol 1.0.0 is an almost complete javascript emulation of the Thymeleaf 2.0 Standard Dialect. It supports all of the standard dialect attributes and allows you to create variables (scalars, structures or collections), initialise them, and evaluate expressions based on their values in your Thymeleaf templates, without requiring a running Thymeleaf template engine at the back-end.

You can if you wish, host Thymeleaf templates, thymol.js and Thymol data files on a remote web server. Thymol 1.0.0 allows complete control of URIs within templates. If necessary, you can control the page access protocol (using thProtocol), you can even create synonyms for URIs (using thMappings).

Thymol 1.0.0 can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jjbenson.u/files/thymol/thymol-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-2013-09-04.zip

There is some documentation at https://sourceforge.net/u/jjbenson/wiki/thymol/

There are some Thymol usage examples in the main Thymol download file.

I've also added Thymol and some Thymol data to the Thymeleaf Petclinic example and have published this at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jjbenson.u/files/thymol/petclinic-with-thymol-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip

Regards,

  Jim
