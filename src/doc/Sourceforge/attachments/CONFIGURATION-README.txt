The latest Thymol javascript libary may be found in the js subdirectory.

In order to get most of the example pages to work properly you will have to download and copy some javascript and css source files to the appropriate sub-directories of the deployment root directory.
You may also have to edit the thymol data and configuration javascript files in individual sub-projects so that the thRoot and/or thPath parameter values map to the correct place in your deployed structure.
